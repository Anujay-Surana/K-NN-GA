Description of Files
main.py: Orchestrates the workflow by loading data, initializing the models, and running the genetic algorithm for optimization.
knn.py: Defines the custom K-NN algorithm with methods for fitting, predicting, and parameter setting.
genetic_algorithm.py: Implements the genetic algorithm for optimizing the K-NN model, including population initialization, evaluation, selection, crossover, and mutation.
data_processing.py: Handles data loading, preprocessing, and splitting into training and testing sets.
Requirements
Python 3.x
NumPy
Pandas
SciPy
Scikit-learn
You can install the required packages using pip:

bash
Copy code
pip install numpy pandas scipy scikit-learn
Usage
1. Data Preparation
Ensure your battery performance data is in a CSV file with appropriate columns. The target variable (e.g., battery batch labels) should be in a column named target.

2. Preprocess Data
The DataProcessor class in data_processing.py handles data loading and preprocessing. It scales the features and splits the data into training and testing sets.

python
Copy code
from data_processing import DataProcessor

data_processor = DataProcessor("battery_data.csv")
X_train, y_train, X_test, y_test = data_processor.preprocess_data()
3. Custom K-NN Algorithm
The CustomKNN class in knn.py defines the custom K-NN algorithm. It includes methods for fitting, predicting, and setting parameters.

python
Copy code
from knn import CustomKNN

knn = CustomKNN()
knn.fit(X_train, y_train)
predictions = knn.predict(X_test)
4. Genetic Algorithm for Optimization
The GeneticAlgorithm class in genetic_algorithm.py implements the genetic algorithm to optimize the K-NN model. It initializes the population, evaluates fitness, selects individuals, performs crossover, and mutation.

python
Copy code
from genetic_algorithm import GeneticAlgorithm

ga = GeneticAlgorithm(knn, X_train, y_train, population_size=50, generations=100)
best_knn = ga.optimize()
print("Best K-NN Configuration:", best_knn.get_params())
5. Running the Project
You can run the entire workflow by executing main.py. This script loads the data, initializes the models, runs the genetic algorithm, and prints the best K-NN configuration.

bash
Copy code
python main.py
Example
Here's a quick example of how the code works:

python
Copy code
# main.py
from knn import CustomKNN
from genetic_algorithm import GeneticAlgorithm
from data_processing import DataProcessor

def main():
    # Load and preprocess data
    data_processor = DataProcessor("battery_data.csv")
    X_train, y_train = data_processor.preprocess_data()

    # Initialize and optimize K-NN with genetic algorithm
    knn = CustomKNN()
    ga = GeneticAlgorithm(knn, X_train, y_train, population_size=50, generations=100)
    best_knn = ga.optimize()

    # Print the best K-NN configuration
    print("Best K-NN Configuration:", best_knn.get_params())

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
